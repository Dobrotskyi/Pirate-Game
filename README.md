# Pirate-Game
This project was built for a portfolio.

You can play the game by downloading the Build.rar unpacking it and launching the .exe file also you can watch some videos of this game at my channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2OqrtKZ_YkSEKxAyMEWSow

In the game, you will be able to sail on three different ships, buy new ships, and experience the spirit of unequal naval battles.
For this project i`ve developed AI that attacks player, roams through docks, ressuplies its needs and avoid obstacles such as other ships or rocks. Tasks like creating waves, environment and creating AI were quite a challenge, but i think i made it well. For AI pathfinding i`ve used NavMesh.
